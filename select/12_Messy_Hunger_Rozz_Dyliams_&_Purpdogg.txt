When I wake up its a chore
A chore just to not think about you
I shuffle off into my kitchen
Make my coffee and keep dreaming
About the way that you smell
About the way you choose your words
You choose them all so well
I just wanna be absurd

I am a peacock strutter
I am a peacock strutter
In search of the touch of another
I have a messy hunger

Never I needed another
I wonder wonder to my other
I had to go on a mission
I wish I could make you my lover

Ohh ohh ohhhh ohh
Ohh ohh ohhhh ohh
Ohh ohh ohhhh ohh
Ohh ohh ohhhh ohh

If you want a certain situation you could tell me
I could facilitate the uneasy feeling in your belly
I could give you the shivers you want I know you miss the feeling
I want you to feel it
Lay with me and look up at the ceiling
Dylan got a one track mind but sometime it slipped off the railing
Hailing from the north to wrap you in a warmer sense of being
Is it something
Is it something that you like the way I'm speaking
I'm a tall glass of water
That I think you should be drinking
