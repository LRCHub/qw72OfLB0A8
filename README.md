# ROSÉ – Messy

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
You and I are tangled as
these sheets
I'm alive,
but I can barely breathe
With your arms around me,
it feels like I'm drownin'
If I reach for somethin'
I can't keep
How bad could it really be?
So, baby, let's get messy,
let's get all the way undone
Come over,
undress me just like I've
never been touched
Baby,
I'm obsessed with you
and there's no replica
Maybe if it's messy,
if it's messy, if it's messy
Then you know it's really love
I want all of your complicated
Give me hell and all of
your worst
When the party's over and
I'm screamin', "I hate it"
How bad could it really hurt
If tonight we just let it burn?
So, baby, let's get messy,
let's get all the way undone
Come over,
undress me just like I've
never been touched
Baby,
I'm obsessed with you
and there's no replica
Maybe if it's messy,
if it's messy, if it's messy
Then you know it's really love,
love
You're pullin' back and
I'm runnin' for the door
You're sayin' those words and
it just makes me want you more
A second chance with our
hearts on the floor
Guess it's love
So, baby, let's get messy,
let's get all the way undone
Come over,
undress me just like I've
never been touched
Baby,
I'm obsessed with you
and there's no replica
Maybe if it's messy,
if it's messy, if it's messy
Then you know it's really love
Love
(Then you know it's really)
Love
Love
